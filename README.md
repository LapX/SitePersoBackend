Personnal website backend : https://lapx.github.io/SitePersoFrontend/#/

Currently only used to generate random data used to populate graphs in a dashboard.

I plan to add a few dashboard components and add persistance.

Users will be able to log in with their google account and create a custom dashboard.

It will be stored in a database and displayed when the user logs back in.
